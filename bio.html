              Lyndsey Myers was born and raised in the jewel of Idaho, Coeur
              d’Alene. She’s interested in photography, writing, and drawing.
              She came into dance later in her collegiate career as she
              discovered her love for movement as another creative outlet. Dance
              has not only been a way that Lyndsey expresses herself but also
              has a way of living connected within herself and to the world.
              Lyndsey graduated at Brigham Young University-Idaho with a
              bachelor in dance, emphasizing in pedagogy with the lens in modern
              and ballroom. During her time at the school, Lyndsey metaled in
              several ballroom competitions including a first place in the
              Argentine Tango. While at school, she trained with Wendy Bone,
              Ashley Storm, Gary Larsen and Shawn Fisher. Lyndsey has a love of
              all facets of dance but has a particular love for choreographing.
              She participated in many research performance concerts during her
              time at BYUI. Other achievements include a 200-hour Hatha Yoga
              teacher certification and experience teaching dance at Junior High
              level.
