                These connections can be found in all aspects of living. As
                human beings, we find connections to each other, to the earth,
                and finally to ourselves. Dance provides an avenue of connective
                exploration between the mind, body and spirit. Movement allows
                for the individual to gain understanding over themselves which
                ultimately leads to a greater understanding of the world around
                us.
              </p>
              <p>
                I connected to life through dance. Dance has brought new
                perspectives and concepts. My eyes have been opened and my
                dreams have only flown higher as I’ve embraced the dance world.
                Since stepping into my first studio during my freshman year of
                college, dance has become an exploration process. As I’ve grown
                in technique and choreography, one clear concept has come forth;
                dance through movement is more about the process then the final
                product. It’s all about finding the connection. Every
                composition is a new door to open; a new connection.
              </p>
              <p>
                My choreography is pulled from everything I know, down to the
                daily routine of my average day. Movement is all around and is
                beautiful in its own right. Dancing allows the ordinary to
                become extraordinary. It has the potential to create stronger
                connections to the world around us and our own personal
                relationships. If my choreography can reach out and connect to
                just one person in the audience, I have achieved my purpose as
                an artist.
